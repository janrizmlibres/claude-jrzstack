# jrzstack

i'm [poteto](https://x.com/poteto). i'm not a president or ceo, but i've worked with millions of lines of code at Meta, Netflix, and Cursor. i'm also on the react core team where i help build and maintain react compiler.

there's a growing sense that ai writes too much slop code. i agree. i don't want to ship like a team of twenty slop artists. throughput without quality is not a goal i aspire to. if you want to go fast, go deep first. 

**pstack is my answer.** these are the same skills i use every day to ship high quality code at Cursor. this turns claude code into a real engineering team. the goal is not to maximize loc, in fact it's the opposite. pstack helps you write less, but higher quality code.

**pstack gives you fearless parallelism.** when you can go deep on one agent and trust it to write good, verifiable code, you can truly parallelize with confidence. start multiple agents up with `savvy-mode` and trust that they'll apply rigorous engineering principles to their work.

**one model family, breadth from prompts.** jrzstack runs on claude models only. where a workflow wants breadth, it gets it from distinct prompts: arena runners each build their own direction, interrogate's reviewers each own one lens of the rubric, and a fresh-context review reads the work without the reasoning that produced it.

fork it. improve it. make it yours. PRs are welcome! 

## install

```
/plugin marketplace add janrizmlibres/claude-jrzstack
/plugin install jrzstack@claude-jrzstack
```

turn on auto-update for the `claude-jrzstack` marketplace in `/plugin`, so every release reaches you. for cloud sessions, paste the setup line from the [claude-jrzstack readme](https://github.com/janrizmlibres/claude-jrzstack) into the environment's setup script.

## get started

two steps:

1. pick a model for each of the three settings in `/config`, or keep the defaults. run [`/jrzstack:setup-jrzstack`](./skills/setup-jrzstack/SKILL.md) to see them.
2. use [`/jrzstack:savvy-mode`](./skills/savvy-mode/SKILL.md) whenever you're doing anything that requires rigor.

new here? the [jrzstack guide](./docs/guide/README.md) walks you through a first real task, from setup and prompting through verification and overnight runs. stuck, or unsure which skill fits? ask [`/jrzstack:savvy-help`](./skills/savvy-help/SKILL.md).

that's it. the other skills are situational, and the mode skill uses them for you as needed. out of the box the mode splits work by setting: code delegates (feature, refactoring, bug fix, perf, hillclimb) run on Work, while the hardest changes, prose, and judgment run on Judgement, and swarm and race workers run on Volume. Work and Judgement default to opus, Volume to sonnet, and the port fixes each setting's effort. `/config` changes the models.

## usage

use [`/jrzstack:savvy-mode`](./skills/savvy-mode/SKILL.md) at the start of a task. it reads your request, picks from a set of playbooks, and runs the other skills as the steps need them.

pick `/jrzstack:savvy-mode` from the `/` menu before you type your task, so claude code loads the skill with the message.

### just use [`/jrzstack:savvy-mode`](./skills/savvy-mode/SKILL.md)

this skill is the main shortcut. i use it whenever i need the agent to do rigorous engineering work. it comes with twenty-four playbooks:

```
/jrzstack:savvy-mode this pr has a subtle bug where the scroll drifts every 750ms even when idle. repro
first, then fix and verify.
```

```
/jrzstack:savvy-mode i'm going to bed. land the stack even if ci flakes. i want everything merged by
morning.
```

</details>



when invoked it:

1. matches your task to a [playbook](./skills/savvy-mode/playbooks/) and opens a todo list whose first items are its steps, copied in verbatim.
2. routes to the other skills as the steps fire.
3. writes unslopped replies framed for the consumer and the maintainer.

the full rules and playbooks live in [`skills/savvy-mode/SKILL.md`](./skills/savvy-mode/SKILL.md).

[`/jrzstack:savvy-mode`](./skills/savvy-mode/SKILL.md) stays on for the rest of the session once you type it: its reminder hook brings it back on every turn, worker results included. it applies itself when a playbook matches or the task needs rigor, and stays out of the way otherwise. say so to opt out. `--resume` drops the hook, so type `/jrzstack:savvy-mode` again after a resume.

[`/jrzstack:savvy-mode`](./skills/savvy-mode/SKILL.md) works extremely well with claude code's `/goal` command. type `/goal` with a condition that can pass or fail, and you can make claude code work for many hours without sacrificing rigor.

## skills

[`/jrzstack:savvy-mode`](./skills/savvy-mode/SKILL.md) runs most of these for you when a step needs them (`how`, `why`, `architect`, `arena`, `swarm`, `interrogate`, `unslop`, `no-comments`, `technical-writing`, `tdd`, and the principles). the table below is for when you want one directly:

```
/jrzstack:how do we cancel runs? do we have an n+1 when we look up every run to cancel?
```

```
/jrzstack:interrogate review this pr.

## savvy-agent, savvy-reader and Comment Sicko

[`/jrzstack:savvy-mode`](./skills/savvy-mode/SKILL.md) runs in the chat that receives it. that chat owns the playbook, the todo list, and every subagent spawn.

jrzstack also ships two agents that run my style for the delegates spawned during a run, a writer and a reader: [`savvy-agent`](./agents/savvy-agent.md) and [`savvy-reader`](./agents/savvy-reader.md). each spawn passes its setting's model and effort. a writer reads `savvy-mode` in full, including its inline principles index, before doing any work. a general-purpose subagent skips that read and drifts. the playbooks spawn these agents themselves. do not spawn `savvy-agent` to run the playbook itself.

[`/jrzstack:savvy-mode`](./skills/savvy-mode/SKILL.md) and [`savvy-agent`](./agents/savvy-agent.md) route through the same wrapper.

jrzstack also ships [Comment Sicko](./agents/comment-sicko.md), a read-only comment reviewer agent. usually invoke it through [`/jrzstack:no-comments`](./skills/no-comments/SKILL.md), not directly.

## principles

twenty-four short skills, one principle each. `savvy-mode` indexes them inline and reads that index at task start. the standalone files are there so other skills can reference a principle by name, and so the index can point at the full rule for each.

<details>
<summary>all twenty-four principles</summary>

| principle | group | rule |
|---|---|---|
| [laziness-protocol](./skills/principle-laziness-protocol/SKILL.md) | core | Bias toward deletion and the smallest change that solves the problem. |
| [foundational-thinking](./skills/principle-foundational-thinking/SKILL.md) | core | Apply before writing logic: choosing core types and data structures, sequencing scaffold-vs-feature work, asking what concurrent actors share. Get the data structures right so downstream code becomes obvious. |
| [redesign-from-first-principles](./skills/principle-redesign-from-first-principles/SKILL.md) | core | Redesign as if the requirement had been a foundational assumption from day one, instead of bolting it on. |
| [attack-the-premise](./skills/principle-attack-the-premise/SKILL.md) | core | Apply when two or more fixes that share one premise have failed the same gate. Write the premise down and test it directly before you write another fix that assumes it. |
| [subtract-before-you-add](./skills/principle-subtract-before-you-add/SKILL.md) | core | Remove dead weight, redundant validators, and stub references first, then build on the simpler base. |
| [minimize-reader-load](./skills/principle-minimize-reader-load/SKILL.md) | core | Count layers between question and answer, and hidden state in the reader's head; collapse one-caller wrappers and shrink mutable scope. |
| [outcome-oriented-execution](./skills/principle-outcome-oriented-execution/SKILL.md) | core | Apply during planned rewrites and migrations with explicit phase boundaries. Converge on the target architecture; don't preserve smooth intermediate states with throwaway compatibility code. |
| [experience-first](./skills/principle-experience-first/SKILL.md) | core | Choose user delight over implementation convenience; ship fewer polished features over more rough ones. |
| [exhaust-the-design-space](./skills/principle-exhaust-the-design-space/SKILL.md) | core | Build 2-3 competing prototypes and compare side by side before committing. |
| [build-the-lever](./skills/principle-build-the-lever/SKILL.md) | core | Apply to any non-trivial work, not just bulk work: edits, migrations, analyses, checks. Build the tool that does it or proves it (codemod, script, generator, or a skill your subagents follow) instead of working by hand. The tool is the artifact a reviewer can rerun. |
| [model-the-domain](./skills/principle-model-the-domain/SKILL.md) | architecture | Encode the domain in a structure instead of scattered conditionals. |
| [boundary-discipline](./skills/principle-boundary-discipline/SKILL.md) | architecture | Concentrate guards at system boundaries (CLI, config, network, external APIs); trust internal types and keep business logic in pure functions. |
| [type-system-discipline](./skills/principle-type-system-discipline/SKILL.md) | architecture | Make illegal states unrepresentable, brand semantic primitives, parse external data at boundaries, exhaust variants, derive from authoritative schemas. |
| [make-operations-idempotent](./skills/principle-make-operations-idempotent/SKILL.md) | architecture | Converge to the same end state regardless of partial prior runs. |
| [migrate-callers-then-delete-legacy-apis](./skills/principle-migrate-callers-then-delete-legacy-apis/SKILL.md) | architecture | Migrate callers and delete the old API in the same wave instead of preserving compatibility layers. |
| [separate-before-serializing-shared-state](./skills/principle-separate-before-serializing-shared-state/SKILL.md) | architecture | Eliminate the sharing first; serialize structurally only when one shared writer is a real invariant. |
| [prove-it-works](./skills/principle-prove-it-works/SKILL.md) | verification | Apply after completing a task, before declaring done. Verify against the real artifact (run the feature, read the actual value, inspect the diff), not a proxy, self-report, or 'it compiles.'. |
| [fix-root-causes](./skills/principle-fix-root-causes/SKILL.md) | verification | Trace each symptom back to the first place the system went wrong and fix it there. A guard is a fix only when the state it handles is legitimate. |
| [sequence-verifiable-units](./skills/principle-sequence-verifiable-units/SKILL.md) | verification | Apply to multi-step work (sweeps, migrations, runs of similar edits) and to how you stack commits and PRs. Break work into small units that each end in a verifiable state, check each before the next, and order delivery so the sequence proves itself to a reviewer. |
| [test-behavior-not-implementation](./skills/principle-test-behavior-not-implementation/SKILL.md) | verification | Apply when you write, change, or keep a test. Assert what the code's users can observe, so the test fails when that behavior breaks and keeps passing when only the internals change. |
| [explain-the-number](./skills/principle-explain-the-number/SKILL.md) | verification | Apply before you trust, report, or act on a number you measured: a speedup, a regression, a throughput, a latency, or an eval result. Find what limits it, and rule out that it measured something other than the work you think. |
| [guard-the-context-window](./skills/principle-guard-the-context-window/SKILL.md) | delegation | Route bulk to subagents; keep summaries in the main thread, not raw payloads. |
| [never-block-on-the-human](./skills/principle-never-block-on-the-human/SKILL.md) | delegation | Proceed, present the result, let the human course-correct after the fact; reserve confirmation for irreversible actions. |
| [encode-lessons-in-structure](./skills/principle-encode-lessons-in-structure/SKILL.md) | meta | Encode the rule as a lint, metadata flag, runtime check, or script instead of more text. |

## borrowed, and not shipped

a few things `savvy-mode` references come from elsewhere:

- `/jrzstack:deslop` and the `deslop` skill ship with jrzstack, vendored from the `cursor-team-kit` plugin and hidden until you type them.
- `control-cli` (for CLIs and TUIs) and `control-ui` (for browser, Electron, web) ship with jrzstack too.
- claude code ships no skill-authoring skill. the authoring playbook uses one if you have it installed (such as `skill-creator`), and otherwise writes the SKILL.md directly.

## why are there no planning skills?

jrzstack has no planning skill. personally, i don't believe in planning. the best spec is code. if you do want to make a plan, [`/jrzstack:savvy-mode`](./skills/savvy-mode/SKILL.md) covers it, but it's not a default. 

## make it yours

`savvy-mode` is my style. you may not want exactly that.

type [`/jrzstack:automate-me`](./skills/automate-me/SKILL.md). it mines your recent transcripts, drafts a `<your-name>-mode` skill from how you've actually worked, and routes through jrzstack underneath. you keep jrzstack as the base and end up with your own routing skill alongside `savvy-mode`.

models and effort are configurable too. pick a model and a starting effort for each of the three settings in `/config`: Work (code delegates and runners), Judgement (the hardest changes, judges and reviewers) and Volume (swarm and race workers). an unset setting keeps its default, so you override only what you want. each spawn raises or lowers the effort to fit its job. type [`/jrzstack:setup-jrzstack`](./skills/setup-jrzstack/SKILL.md) to see the settings and get the setup line that carries them to cloud environments.
